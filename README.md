## How to Run
The dealer deals one card to the player, face up and one card to himself face down. Then he deals one card to the player face up and one card to himself face up. Then he offers a card to the player.
The player may accept cards from the dealer, or he may "stand" (stand means that he takes no more cards). If the player gets more than 21 points, he loses immediately. When the player stops taking cards, the dealer turns over his face down card and begins to lay down cards for himself.
The dealer must continue to take cards until he gets 17 points or more, at which time he stops. If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins.
If both the player and the dealer are under 21, then the one who is closest to 21 wins. If there is a tie, the player wins.
