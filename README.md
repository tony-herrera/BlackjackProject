# Blackjack Project


## Overview
The summary of this project is to see how abstracts, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation all work together to bring together the fun classic
game of Blackjack.
It uses the fundamentals of object oriented programming and allows the user to take part in a head to head match with the
dealer to get the best hand.


## Lessons Learned
* Getting comfortable building classes in an Object-Oriented manner.
* Building classes whose fields are Objects.
* Practice writing methods.
* Use collection types to organize and manage data.
* Use conditionals to create game logic.


## How to Run
1. The dealer deals one card to the player, face up and one card to the dealer face down.
2. Then the dealer deals one card to the player face up and one card to himself face up.
3. Then the dealer offers a card to the player.
4. The player may accept cards from the dealer, or may "stand" (stand means that he takes no more cards). If the player gets more than 21 points, he loses immediately.
5. When the player stops taking cards, the dealer turns over his face down card and begins to lay down cards for himself.
6. The dealer must continue to take cards until he gets 17 points or more, at which time he stops. If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins.
7. If both the player and the dealer are under 21, then the one who is closest to 21 wins. If there is a tie, the player wins.
